## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The world of electric vehicles is finally upon us and forever growing, our group has found a dataset that represents ownership of electric vehicles in the state of Washington. More specifically, we hope to be looking at differences of sales trends for makes and types of EV in areas such as Easts vs West and North vs South. The interest in this dataset comes from the curiosity of the future of EVs. With the demand for EVs growing, there are many companies creating what they hope to be the best option. That makes this a topic of interest because it might be able to highlight sales trends based on geographical locations. It would be interesting to also analyse the demographic of people buying EVs in terms of where they live, average salary, etc.
